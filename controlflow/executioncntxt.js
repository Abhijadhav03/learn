// 1. Global execution context => this 

//2. memory phase 

// 3. execution phase 


//first in global execution context this is allocated and the var in this context is given as undefined
//whereas the function is allocated as definition
// if functions are there then memory phase and execution context of the function separate again
//once the code is executed the context created by fuction is deleted
